# Hadoop #

This module was created to assist with the installation and configuration of hadoop. Simply edit the params.pp file and mapreduce your self away!

# Configuration #

* A tar.gz file needs to be placed into ~/modules/hadoop/files. You can download hadoop from here: http://hadoop.apache.org/common/releases.html
* Once downloaded the params.pp file needs to be updated with the version downloaded. 
* The params.pp also requires the java module I have already published. That or the $java_home variable needs to be properly updated.
